dotfiles
========

This is a repository of my dotfiles. These dotfiles can be used by running
the setup.sh script. The script will proceed to backup existing dotfiles that
will be replaced if they exist and then setup a softlink to the files in the
repo.

These are my files and you're welcome to use them.
