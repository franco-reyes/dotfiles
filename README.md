dotfiles
========

This is a repository of my dotfiles. These dotfiles can be used by setting up a softlink to them.

Example in your home directory:

ln -s $LOC_TO_REPO/vimrc .vimrc

would create a .vimrc softlink to the vimrc file in your dotfile repo.

These are my files and you're welcome to use them.
